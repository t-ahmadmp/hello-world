# hello-world
Tutorial exercise from GitHub.

Hello. I'm Tengku Ahmad, trying GitHub for the first time.
I'm from Dumai (not Dubai), then move to Pekanbaru, and now I'm
in Bandung, studying for undergraduate degree.

My friend Hammas told me to use GitHub for our IEEE EDC 2015 project, so here I am now.
